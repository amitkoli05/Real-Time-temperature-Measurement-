Temperature Measurement System using Arduino Uno

#Introduction

Iâ€™m excited to present my latest project â€” a Temperature Measurement System built using an Arduino Uno, an NTC thermistor sensor, and a 4-digit 7-segment display.
This project is designed to measure and display real-time temperature using the voltage divider principle, showcasing how analog sensors can be interfaced with microcontrollers for practical applications.

# Project Overview

The NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistor changes its resistance as temperature varies â€” resistance decreases when temperature increases.
By combining it with a fixed resistor, we form a voltage divider circuit. The Arduino reads this varying voltage through its analog input pin, converts it to a temperature value (in Â°C), and displays it on the 4-digit 7-segment display.

# Working Principle

Voltage Divider:


The output voltage changes as the thermistorâ€™s resistance changes with temperature.

Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC):
Arduino Unoâ€™s 10-bit ADC converts the analog voltage (0â€“5V) into digital values (0â€“1023).

Temperature Calculation:
Using the voltage and known resistor values, the thermistor resistance is calculated and converted into temperature using the Steinhartâ€“Hart equation or a simple approximation.

Display:
The calculated temperature is then displayed in real time on the 4-digit 7-segment display.
